# Project Description
This project is a landing page with animations and a slider, developed using **React** and **SCSS**.

The landing page is a single-page website designed to showcase a product, service, or business. The page is designed to be visually appealing, with animations and a slider to create an engaging user experience. The slider allows the user to scroll through different sections of the landing page, each with its own unique content.

The project is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and SCSS, a preprocessor scripting language for CSS. React was chosen for its ease of use and modular approach to building web applications. SCSS was used to simplify the process of writing CSS, allowing for faster and more efficient development.

The landing page includes several animations, such as hover effects, fade-ins, and transitions, to create a dynamic and engaging user experience. The slider is implemented using React's built-in functionality, with custom styling using SCSS.
